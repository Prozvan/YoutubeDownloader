# YoutubeDownloader(CMD)

#### With it you can download .mp3 and .mp4 (Max: 720p) files. It works with youtube links and search query.


How it works (Simple):
- First, it gets a LINK or a SEARCH QUERY from a user in CMD
- Second it gets a FORMAT from a user => .mp3 or .mp4
- if the user types a LINK, it asks for a preferred download directory and downloads it
- but for SEARCH QUERY it has to search it on YouTube first and then the same process like LINK


Have fun :)
